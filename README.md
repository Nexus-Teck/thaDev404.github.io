I added extra two light features to my Pixel Art Maker, that makes it more interactive.

* Download Canvas Feature - after designing with colors as it suits you, this feature allows you to downlaod your beautifully painted design canvas in form of a png image.
 
* Preview Download Feature - which allows you to preview you design canvas before download.

This *README.md* file was formatted using **markdown**.
